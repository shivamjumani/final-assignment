          <h2>Los Angeles County's Greenhouse gas emmissions dashboard</h2>
          <p>Los Angeles County is drafting a plan, <a href="https://ourcountyla.org/">Out County</a> which will present
             a comprehensive pathway to sustainability, addressing a wide range of subjects including
             climate change, water, energy, resource management, land use, transportation, open space,
             biodiversity, public health, economy and workforce development, housing, resilience, and
             governance. Countywide goals and strategies will be informed by data as well as stakeholder
             and community engagement. </p>
          <p>To supplement this effort, I have created a dashboard that allows the public
          to look at the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of all the 88 cities in LA County, broken
          down by source (Stationary Energy (energy produced on site), Transportation, Waste,
          Industrial Processes and Agriculture). Hover over the city to get these details.
